=============================================
Welcome to the legate-dataframe documentation
=============================================

``legate-dataframe`` is a prototype of a legate-enabled version of libcudf.
This is not a drop-in replacement of Pandas, instead it follows the low-level API of libcudf.

In the future, we plan to introduce a high-level and user friendly Python package
using these low-level API's primitives.
